# StreamChat



# 🤖 Real-Time Object Detection / Chatbot App using Streamlit

This project is a lightweight and interactive web application built using **Streamlit**. Depending on the module used (`chat.py`, `import streamlit as st.py`), it enables real-time object detection, chat interfaces, or other AI functionalities via an easy-to-use web UI.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this app is to allow users to interact with AI-based tools such as:
- 🔍 **Object Detection**: Upload images or stream from webcam to detect objects in real-time.
- 💬 **Chatbot Interface**: A conversational AI interface that can respond to user input dynamically.

## 🧠 Features

- Streamlit-based web interface.
- Real-time interaction with models (YOLOv8, GPT-style, etc.).
- User-friendly file/image input system.
- Live outputs rendered on the browser.
